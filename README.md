# ðŸ’Ž Interactive Diamond Price Predictor & Explainer

This project is a comprehensive machine learning application that predicts the price of diamonds based on their characteristics. Unlike a basic prediction model, this project also provides an "explainer" component, visually demonstrating which features have the most significant impact on the final price.

This unique approach showcases not only predictive modeling skills but also an understanding of model interpretability, which is a highly valued skill in the industry.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Diamond Price Prediction:** Uses a powerful machine learning model to predict the price of a diamond.
- **Feature Importance Visualization:** Generates a bar chart to show the influence of each feature (carat, cut, color, etc.) on the price prediction.
- **Interactive Input:** Allows the user to input the characteristics of a new diamond to get a real-time price prediction.
- **Robust Code:** Clean, well-structured, and commented Python code.
